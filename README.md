Tools and code used during my talk at BSides Augusta 2017
========

[__Security Automation in the cloud__](http://bsidesaugusta.org)

September 16th, 2017

------
##CloudFormation Template
Template used for demos is based on my existing CFN template to automate deploy of Security Monkey. For additional steps after deployment please go to that repo documentation here [here](https://github.com/toniblyx/security_monkey_cloudformation)
###What does this CFN template?
1. Creates a VPC with a public subnet for two instances and a private subnet for RDS (Pgsql used by SecurityMonkey)
2. One instance is dedicated to Security Monkey the other has Tools and sample code on it like: [Prowler](https://github.com/Alfresco/prowler), [ThreatResponse Tools](https://github.com/ThreatResponse) (see the template for details)
